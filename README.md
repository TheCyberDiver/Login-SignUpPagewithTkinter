## Why this project?
I used documentation from tkinter and SQL plugin for making this. I wanted a better understanding of how we could use SQL servers for authentication in code.


### How to
To get the login page working, create a mysql database and create a table named login. Add two columns to the table, username and password.
Then change the connection settings in the code. Or you can completely take out the DB. I did it as a learning experience.
